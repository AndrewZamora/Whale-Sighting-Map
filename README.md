This is a map of recent whale sightings.

## Getting Started
1. Create a Google Maps API key
2. Create a file called .env in the main directory
3. Add this to the .env file plus your API key 
```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY= Your API Key here
```
(You can change the variable name to anything you like but make sure it starts with  "REACT_APP_". )

4. Add this to your .gitignore file so that you don't expose your API key 
```
.env
``` 
5. In your terminal enter the following to install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
6. Get it running with: 
```
npm start
```
